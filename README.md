# 🌍 2025 Global Population Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
# 📘 Project Overview
The 2025 Global Population Analysis Power BI project provides a comprehensive demographic overview of the world’s population across 233 countries.

It brings together data on population growth, fertility trends, migration, density, and demographic shifts, offering an interactive way to explore how populations evolve over time.

This dashboard was created to simplify complex demographic data and help policymakers, researchers, and analysts understand global population dynamics visually and intuitively.

# 🎯 Objective / Problem Statement
To analyze and visualize global population trends for 2025, focusing on:

* **Which countries contribute most to global population growth** *
* **How fertility rates and median age correlate** *
* **Migration patterns and population density comparisons** *
* **Identifying high and low growth regions globally** *
# 📊 Dataset Description
* **Source: [Kaggle – Global Population Dataset]https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asadullahcreative/world-population-by-country-2025** *
* **Size: 233 Countries / Regions** *
* **Main Columns:** *
Country
Population (2025)
Yearly Change (Growth)
Net Change
Fertility Rate
Median Age
Urban Population %
World Share
Land Area (Km²)
Migrants
Data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query within Power BI before visualization.

# 🧠 Key Insights
* **🇮🇳 India (1.46B) has overtaken China (1.42B) as the world’s most populous country in 2025.** *
* **🌱 Tokelau, Oman, and Syria show the highest growth rates (~0.04), while Poland, Greece, and Cook Islands show population decline.** *
* **🏙️ Bangladesh has an extremely high population density (1350 people/km²), while Russia remains sparsely populated.** *
* **👵 Developed nations like Japan, Germany, and Italy face aging populations (median age >45) and low fertility rates (<1.5).** *
* **🌏 Migration flows are significant from Ukraine and Syria toward the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.** *
# ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
* **Power BI Desktop (.pbix)** *
* **Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation** *
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures and KPIs** *
* **Excel / CSV (Kaggle dataset)** *
# 📈 Dashboard Highlights
The report is structured into four main pages, each focused on a distinct demographic perspective:

# 1️⃣ Population Insights
* **Global KPIs: 233 Countries, 8B Total Population, 20.2K Total Migrants** *
* **Charts displaying population by country, land area, and world share** *
* **Comparison between large and small nations by total population** *
# 2️⃣ Growth and Trends Change
* **Visual analysis of Fertility Rate vs. Population Growth** *
* **Identification of positive and negative growth countries** *
* **Impact of migration on overall population growth** *
# 3️⃣ Migration & Density Analysis
* **Population density visualized by both land area and population** *
* **Migration inflow and outflow by country** *
* **Top immigration destinations (Ukraine, U.S.) and emigration sources (Pakistan, India)** *
# 4️⃣ Demographic Patterns
* **Fertility Rate vs. Median Age comparisons** *
* **Urban Population % vs. Age correlation** *
* **Highlights of countries with aging populations and declining fertility** *
# 🧮 Data Model & DAX
* **Model:** *
Single flat table optimized with measures and calculated columns.
* **Key DAX Measures:** *
Total Population = SUM(Data[Population])
Total Migrants = SUM(Data[Migrants])
Growth Rate = DIVIDE([Net Change], [Population])
Population Density = DIVIDE([Population], [Land Area])

# 💡 Business Impact / Conclusion
This analysis enables data-driven decisions in areas like:

* **🏗️ Urban planning and infrastructure — understanding density hotspots** *
* **🏥 Healthcare and education policy — based on aging and fertility trends** *
* **🌍 Migration management — tracking movement patterns** *
* **📊 Global development planning — aligning growth trends with sustainability goals** *
